FakeMark
========

Summary: FakeMark is a set of conventions added to media files to signify
that the content has been altered significantly from the original. The intent
is to enable content producers to signal that media was intentionally altered
from the original. The goal of FakeMark is not to propose a secure solution
to the problem of fake media, but to enable new norms to grow and evolve surrounding
how altered media is produced and consumed.

Background
==========

Media presented for consumption generally has a tacit grounding: real, fake, or ambiguous.

Real media is meant to be a depiction of reality while fake media has been
altered for effect. Media can also be intentionally presented with ambiguous provenance
in order to provoke more critical thought from the viewer. However, the advance
of technology has seen the rapid increase of fake and ambiguous media in popular culture.

FakeMark is a small, first step to allow media producers a simple way of signaling
that their content is intented as fake. The primary use case is fron researchers or
those showcasing media manipulation techniques to keep their produced works from
being easily shared out of context.

FakeMark is not intended to be a secure solution to adversaries. Use of FaceMark is strictly
voluntary as there are often very compelling reasons to create and present media that is ambiguous in nature. FakeMark is instead meant to be
a starting point to establish richer social norms on how media is produced and
shared.

Best Practices
==============
Currently, FakeMark can be applied to visual media such as images or videos. The content
consists of a capital blue "F" and should appear in the bottom right corner. This
repo contains refrence implementations, but content providers are free to reinterpret
these within the spirit of the proposal.
